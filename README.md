# Real Time Youtube Trending Classifier
The focus of this project was to improve the YouTube algorithm for determining trending videos utilizing a generic decision tree classification model from the SPARK framework. In this work, comment counts, likes, dislikes, and other metrics are used as features to determine community engagement per video for each region of the world. The means of comment counts per region are utilized as thresholds to classify each video as either engaged or non-engaged. Videos with high community engagement should be considered trending videos.
